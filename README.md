# AutoGrid Pet Clinic

I tried to add Hilla and AutoCrud to the Spring Pet Clinic project.

Unfortunately, I hit two problems:

1. issue https://github.com/vaadin/hilla/issues/1529 makes it impossible to use the Pet Clinic entities as they are;
2. issue https://github.com/vaadin/hilla/issues/1530 means that I didn't get the exception from previous issue in the logs and I thought it was some misconfiguration in the project.

So basically the project is not working and the only outcome are those issues to work on.
