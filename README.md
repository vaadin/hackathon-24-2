# hackathon-24-2

I've updated my customer application to Vaadin 24.2.0.rc2 and try the Appsec-kit.

I opened some tickets:
- Unable to use the View in an app secured by Spring: https://github.com/vaadin/appsec-kit/issues/105
- Make the AppSecKit view more responsive: https://github.com/vaadin/appsec-kit/issues/107
- Can't run the Application.java directly: https://github.com/vaadin/appsec-kit/issues/108

Nothing to show.
