# hackathon-24-2

* No demoable code, but:
  * Tested Vaadin 24.2.0.rc2 in Karibu-Testing, everything works
  * Added DSL for SvgIcon and FontIcon into Karibu-DSL
  * Posted a question "Why does only LoginOverlay contain the footer+custom form area functionality, but the LoginForm doesn't? Is there a reason for that?" into Slack `#components-user` channel
  * Will add DSL for Login footer + custom form area once this is sorted out
